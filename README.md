# Network Uptime

### Cut out the cruft from syslog and see the last time your network device re-connected

This is a simple tool I created for monitoring my `i219-LM` network card, which is poorly supported by Ubuntu and keeps disconnecting, so I can try different `e1000e.ko` files and see which one is most stable

Convert time to 12hr format for easy reading at a glance

Created easy path to comment out the question about which device you want to monitor in case you'd rather not specify each time
